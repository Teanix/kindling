# Create pull request
We’re excited that you want to join us. This doc explains the process for creating a pull request for the Kindling project.
​

## Before you submit a pull request
Fist-time contributors should read the [Contributor Guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.
Make sure your pull request adheres to relevant code conventions.

## Your first pull request
If this is your first time contributing to an open-source project on GitHub, make sure you read about [Creating a pull request](contribute/creating-a-pull-request).
To increase the chance of having your pull request accepted, make sure your pull request follows these guidelines:

- Title and description match the implementation.
- Commits within the pull request follow the Commit Message Guidelines
- The pull request closes one related issue.
- The pull request contains necessary tests that verify the intended behavior.
- If your pull request has conflicts, rebase your branch onto the main branch.

If the pull request fixes a bug:

- The pull request description must include Closes #<issue number> or Fixes #<issue number>.
- To avoid regressions, the pull request should include tests that replicate the fixed bug.
## Run Local Verifications

You must run local verifications before you submit your pull request.

## Code review
Once you've created a pull request, the next step is to have someone review your change. A review is a learning opportunity for both the reviewer and the author of the pull request.

If you think a specific person needs to review your pull request, then you can tag them in the description or in a comment. Tag a user by typing the @ symbol followed by their GitHub username.

We recommend that you read [How to do a code review](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/) to learn more about code reviews.

## Commit Message Guidelines
Git commit message is the best way to communicate context about a change to fellow developers. Git commit message should accurately describe both what and why it is being done. Commit Messages are usually comprised of two parts: subject and body. Subject and body content should better follow these guides most of which follow the ones of Kubernetes [commit message guidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/pull-requests.md):

+ Separate subject from body with a blank line 
+ Subject start with area tag
+ Limit the subject line to 50 characters
+ Do not end the subject line with a period
+ Wrap the body at 72 characters
+ Use the imperative mood in the subject line
+ Use the body to explain what and why this commit

**Here is a git commit message example:**
```
agent: add tcp packet drop metric

Enhance the ability of identifying tcp layer problem
```
